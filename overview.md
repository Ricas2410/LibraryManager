1. System Goals & Scope
This library management system is meant exclusively for one school (elementary through high school). Its primary functions include tracking books, managing user records (students, teachers, librarians), handling borrowing/return transactions, and facilitating efficient location and availability management of physical books. The system is intended for internal use with a focus on simplicity, reliability, and ease of use.

2. Functional Requirements
A. Book Management
Inventory Records:

Maintain detailed records for each book (Title, Author, ISBN, Publication Date, Genre)

Specify physical location data (e.g., shelf, section, floor).

Track current status (available, borrowed, reserved, missing).

Indexing & Categorization:

Ability to index books by multiple attributes (title, author, genre, location).

Advanced search functionality with filters and sorting.

B. User Management
Profiles & Registration:

Record user details: full name, contact information, enrollment/class details.

Define distinct roles such as Administrator, Librarian, Teacher, and Student.

Authentication & Authorization:

Secure login system with role-based access.

Manage permissions to restrict certain functionalities (only admins or librarians can add/edit books).

C. Loan and Transaction Management
Borrowing Process:

Record each loan with user details, book ID, borrow date, and due date.

Automatically mark status changes (e.g., when a book is returned).

Return Process & Notifications:

Capture return date and update the status.

Optional email/SMS notifications for due or overdue books.

Reservation/Booking (Optional):

Allow users to reserve a book if currently checked out.

D. Search & Reporting
Search:

Fast retrieval based on indexed data (using title, author, ISBN, or location).

Include pagination or real-time search suggestions.

Reporting:

Generate reports such as overdue checkouts, most borrowed books, and inventory summaries.

Export functionality for reports (e.g., CSV or PDF).

E. Administrative & System Settings
Data Management:

CRUD operations for books, users, and transactions.

Logging changes or transactions for audit purposes.

System Settings:

Configure library policies (loan period, fines, notifications).

Backup and recovery options.

3. Non-Functional Requirements
Performance & Scalability:

Optimized search with proper database indexing.

Lightweight and responsive interface, even on lower-end devices within the school network.

Security:

Use HTTPS for data transmission.

Secure authentication practices and encrypted sensitive data.

Regular backups and data validation.

Usability:

Clean, intuitive user interface.

Responsive design for use on desktops, tablets, or even smartphones.

Accessible for users with different levels of technical proficiency.

Maintainability:

Modular architecture for easy updates and bug fixes.

Detailed documentation for developers and administrators.

4. Suggested System Architecture
A. Presentation Layer (User Interface)
Web Application:

Frontend Framework: React with a component-based architecture.

UI Libraries: Material-UI or Bootstrap for responsive design.

Optional Desktop Client:

An additional Windows application using WPF (if offline operation or specialized features are required) can be built in parallel.

B. Business Logic Layer
APIs & Middleware:

Develop RESTful APIs to handle the core operations (CRUD for books, user operations, loan management).

Validation logic and business rules for borrowing policies.

Framework Options:

Django (Python) 

C. Data Access Layer
ORMs:

For Django, its built-in ORM is very powerful.

D. Database Layer
Relational Database:
Primary Options: sqlite for development, MySQL or PostgreSQL for production, scalable performance.

Indexing Strategy:
Use primary keys on key fields (BookID, UserID, LoanID).

Non-clustered indexes on searchable fields such as Title, Author, ISBN, and Location.

Consider full-text search features if the database supports it.
